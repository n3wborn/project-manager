# Project Manager


1. What ?

    - admin side: a CRUD for projects I did, or the ones I'm currently working on
    - user side: a way to show my work
    - a Symfony 6.3 / Vite / Caddy (/ React ?) stack based on [n3wborn/symfo6.2-vite-caddy](https://github.com/n3wborn/symfo6.2-vite-caddy)

2. Why ?

    - it can be useful when it comes to resume my own previous/current projects
    - I can learn new stuff and improve what I already know
    - it can be fun
